# Data Description

The data here is a pickled format of the MNIST data set. The pickle module was used to create the data set.
From the python documentation at https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html :
 “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream
 No further processing was done to the data downloaded from the book's linked sources.
